# Simple Website Visitor Counter Options

Since Google Analytics might be complex, here are **simpler alternatives** to track visitors to your GitHub Pages website:

## Option 1: GitHub Traffic Insights (Built-in)
GitHub provides basic traffic analytics for GitHub Pages repositories:
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/chuhandanielzhang/chuhandanielzhang.github.io
2. Click "**Insights**" tab at the top
3. Click "**Traffic**" in the left sidebar
4. Here you'll see:
   - Page views in the last 14 days
   - Unique visitors in the last 14 days
   - Popular pages
   - Referring sites

**Note**: This is limited to the last 14 days only.

## Option 2: Add a Simple View Counter
I can add a simple hit counter to your website that shows total page views. This would be visible on your website and update automatically.

## Option 3: Microsoft Clarity (Free & Simple)
Microsoft Clarity is a simpler, free alternative to Google Analytics:
1. Go to https://clarity.microsoft.com/
2. Sign up with your Microsoft/Google account
3. Add your website
4. Get a tracking code
5. I'll add it to all your pages

**Benefits**:
- Visual heatmaps (see where people click)
- Session recordings (watch how people navigate)
- Simple dashboard
- No complex setup

## Option 4: Visitor Badge (Simple Counter)
I can add a visitor badge that shows a counter on your website. This displays total page views publicly.

## Recommendation
For personal academic websites like yours, I'd recommend:
1. **GitHub Insights** - Already available, check it first!
2. **Microsoft Clarity** - If you want more detailed behavior analytics
3. **Google Analytics** - If you want the most comprehensive data

Which option would you like me to set up?
