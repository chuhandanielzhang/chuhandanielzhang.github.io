# Website Analytics Setup Guide

## Overview
To track visitors to your GitHub Pages website, you can add Google Analytics 4 (GA4). This is a free tool that provides detailed statistics about your website visitors.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create a Google Analytics Account
1. Go to https://analytics.google.com/
2. Sign in with your Google account (or create one if you don't have one)
3. Click "Start measuring"

### 2. Create a Property
1. Enter an account name (e.g., "Personal Website")
2. Click "Next"
3. Enter property name: "Chuhan Zhang's Website"
4. Select reporting time zone
5. Choose currency
6. Click "Next"

### 3. Configure Your Property
1. Select your industry category
2. Choose business size
3. Select how you intend to use Google Analytics
4. Click "Create" and accept the terms

### 4. Get Your Measurement ID
1. You'll see "Streams" → Click "Add stream" → Select "Web"
2. Enter your website URL: `https://chuhandanielzhang.github.io`
3. Stream name: "Main Website"
4. Click "Create stream"
5. You'll see a **Measurement ID** that looks like: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`
6. **Copy this Measurement ID** - you'll need it in the next step

### 5. Add Analytics to Your Website
Once you have your Measurement ID, I can add the Google Analytics tracking code to all your HTML pages. Just provide me with your Measurement ID and I'll integrate it for you.

## What You'll See
After setup, you can view:
- **Real-time visitors**: Who is currently on your site
- **Daily/Weekly/Monthly visitors**: Total number of visitors
- **Popular pages**: Which pages get the most views
- **Visitor demographics**: Country, device type, browser
- **Traffic sources**: How people found your site
- **User engagement**: Average time on site, bounce rate

## Privacy Note
Google Analytics respects user privacy and provides aggregated, anonymized data. You won't see personal information about individual visitors.

## Alternative: Simple Counter
If you prefer a simpler solution without Google Analytics, I can add a basic view counter. However, GA4 provides much more detailed insights.
