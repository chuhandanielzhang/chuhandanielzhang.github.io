                <h3 class="subsection-title">Nothing But Net - Team 9698B (Middle School)</h3>
                <div class="project-content">
                    <p>In this season, the game objective is to shoot balls into high-mounted baskets to score points.</p>
                    <p>I co-founded and captained Team 9698B, guiding four classmates from initial concept to a fully operational robot. We managed the entire process‚Äîbrainstorming, CAD design, programming, and integration‚Äîas a collaborative team.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Our Creation & Key Innovations</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Agile Movement</strong>: We built a holonomic drivetrain for superior mobility, allowing our robot to strafe and reposition with ease.</li>
                        <li><strong>Efficient Collection & Launching</strong>: I designed a wide roller intake system to gather balls, which were then fed into a dual-flywheel launcher. By implementing a PID control loop with encoder feedback, we achieved consistent, high-accuracy shots.</li>
                        <li><strong>Smart Architecture</strong>: Our "front-intake, front-shooter" design was not only intuitive for drivers but also enabled unique scoring angles, even from directly beneath the goal.</li>
                        <li><strong>Autonomous Precision</strong>: I programmed a reliable 15-second autonomous routine that scored pre-loaded balls and navigated to a strategic starting position.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Tower Takeover - Team 9666A (High School)</h3>
                <div class="project-content">
                    <p>In this season, the game objective is to place cubes into scoring zones and towers to achieve the highest score.</p>
                    <p>Entering high school, I founded a new robotics club and led Team 9666A. This time, I took on a mentorship role, guiding two beginners through their first build. We used project management tools like Notion to structure our workflow, with weekly goals and learning modules to ensure steady progress.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Our Robot & Key Features</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>High-Capacity Handling</strong>: We engineered a tilting tray mechanism that could collect and hold up to 10 cubes, using reversible rollers for precise control.</li>
                        <li><strong>Articulated Stacking Arm</strong>: I developed a parallelogram lift with an articulating intake. This clever mechanism ensured a clean release of stacked cubes as the robot moved away.</li>
                        <li><strong>Driver-Friendly Automation</strong>: To simplify the complex stacking task, I coded a 'one-touch stacking' macro. This driver-assist feature automated the lift-and-place sequence, allowing us to execute consistent, high-scoring stacks under pressure.</li>

                    <p>RoboMaster is DJI's premier robotics competition that combines engineering innovation with strategic gameplay. University teams from around the world design, build, and program autonomous and manually-controlled robots to compete in an intense 5v5 battle format on a futuristic arena. The competition challenges teams across multiple disciplines: mechanical engineering for robust chassis and firing systems, electrical engineering for power management and sensors, computer vision for autonomous targeting, and software engineering for control algorithms and strategic coordination.</p>
                    <p>The RoboMaster University League (RMUL) serves as a premier platform for university students to showcase their technical skills, fostering innovation in robotics and providing real-world engineering experience. With over 200 participating teams worldwide, the competition pushes the boundaries of what's possible in tactical robotics and collaborative autonomous systems.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">RoboMaster University League - Kongfu Team</h3>
                <div class="project-content">
                    <p>During my university studies, I co-founded my school's first RoboMaster team‚ÄîKongfu Team‚Äîand served as the Mechanical Advisor & Co-Founder. Together with like-minded friends, I led the development of our inaugural competition robot, driving innovation from concept to execution.</p>
                    
                    <h3>My Role: Mechanical Advisor & Co-Founder</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mechanical Design & FEA Optimization</strong>: Led the complete mechanical design process, from initial CAD modeling to structural optimization. I applied Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to analyze the chassis's torsional rigidity and the gimbal's stability against projectile impacts. This analysis guided material selection and removed redundant material, reducing overall weight while ensuring combat durability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Chassis & Mobility Strategy</strong>: Engineered a holonomic X-Drive (four omni-wheels mounted at 45¬∞) that enabled a circular chassis profile. This was a key tactical advantage, allowing for rapid "spinning" maneuvers ("Â∞èÈôÄËû∫" mode) without catching corners on walls and maximizing the robot's footprint within competition rules.</li>
                        <li><strong>All-Terrain Suspension System</strong>: Designed an independent suspension system for each wheel. This was critical for ensuring all four omni-wheels maintained constant ground contact, even when navigating over on-field debris (like spent projectiles), guaranteeing consistent traction and maneuverability for the holonomic drive.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gimbal & Systems Integration</strong>: Developed the high-stiffness precision gimbal (analyzed via FEA) and coordinated the physical assembly and integration of all mechanical components, ensuring seamless fit and function between the custom chassis, suspension, gimbal, and the robot's electrical and control systems.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Team Achievements</h3>
