# ðŸ“¸ Adding RoboMaster Photos

## Two Photos Needed

Please add the following two photos to the RoboMaster section:

1. **robotics-robomaster-main.jpg**
   - Description: Robot at competition with RoboMaster banner background
   - Shows detailed robot with hexagonal panels, colorful wires, camera lens, and "ROBOMASTER" labeled module

2. **robotics-robomaster-team.jpg**
   - Description: Low-angle shot of robot #3 with omni-directional wheels
   - Shows black robot with glowing red accents and white "3" on front

## How to Add

1. **Save your photos** in the project root directory with these exact names:
   - `robotics-robomaster-main.jpg`
   - `robotics-robomaster-team.jpg`

2. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add robotics-robomaster-main.jpg robotics-robomaster-team.jpg robotics.html
   git commit -m "Add RoboMaster Kongfu Team photos"
   git push
   ```

3. **Images will automatically appear** in the RoboMaster section with hover zoom effects!

## Note

The HTML is already set up in `robotics.html` to display these images. Once you add the image files with the correct names, they will appear on the website.
